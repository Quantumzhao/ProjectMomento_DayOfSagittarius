- A map (Battlefield) of normal size should be approx. 50x50 unity units.<br>

- Which represents a battlefield of approx. 150 000 000 000 m (1.5 x 10<sup>11</sup>) in size.  

- Therefore: 

    - Light speed in game is about 2.5 unity unit per second. 

    - It takes about 20 seconds for a light pulse to travel from one end of the map to another. 

- In other words, 

    - space is scaled by 1 / 3 000 000 000, 1 / 3 x 10 <sup>9</sup>. 

    - And time is scaled by 1/ 10.
