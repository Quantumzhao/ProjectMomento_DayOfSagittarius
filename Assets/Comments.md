- <br>The space is approx. 150 000 000 000 m (1.5 x 10<sup>11</sup>) in size.  

- It takes about 20 seconds for a light pulse to travel from one end of the map to another. 

- Therefore: 

    - Time is scaled by 1 / 25. 

    - Light speed in game is about 10 unity unit per second. 

- In other words, 

    - A map (Battlefield) of normal size should be approx. 200 x 200 unity units.

    - Space is scaled by 1 / 750 000 000, 1 / 3 x 10 <sup>9</sup>.
