# About Shuyu

Shuyu is a sci-fi real time strategy game, which players take controll on their space fleet and fight battles in interstella space. It will be completely based on physics, which means no information or physical entity can travel faster than light. 

Therefore, light speed becomes a critical factor when devicing strategy.

## About Project Momento: Day of Sagittarius

Theoratically, it will take a long time to fully implement all of the contents of Shuyu, since only myself is writting the code and do all of other stuff. So I divided the developement into several stages. 

And project Momento is the code for the first stage developement of Shuyu, and Day of Sagittarius is the code for its first section. 

## Current Progress:

- [ ] Stage 1: ProjectMomento
  
    - [ ] Section 1: Day of Sagittarius
    - Here is the preview of the very first version of "Day of Sagittarius"
      ![Preview](https://github.com/Quantumzhao/ProjectMomento_DayOfSagittarius/blob/master/DEMO%200.png)

    ### Goal

    - Multiplayer mode on intranet

    - Basic operations such as mobilize vessels and fire main weapon and auxiliary weapon

    - Completely handle delay in transmission between units

## Features of Shuyu

- Being different from conventional RTS games, there is no possibilities for players to acquire all of the information of the battlefield: all information   that player received are delayed due to light speed barrier. Anything could     happen at next moment. 

  Therefore, players should take the uncertainty of information into consideration. It is a great disadvantage to you, as well as to your opponent. 

- Players can modify their vessels. Actually, players are encouraged to build   their own unique fleet ,which best accomodate their strategy and tactic. However, it also means that players know little about their opponents' vessel in first encounter. 

- There are many kinds of weapons available for players to choose. Different weapons fire different shells, varying from gamma ray, to kinetic torpedoes. 

- Each vessel hold different numbers of staff. If the casualty of a vessel increases, the time taken for executing any command will be longer. On the other hand, as the staff are more experienced, time for executing commands will be significantly decreased. 

  The total elimination of staff on any vessel disables its functionality. Any forces can send troops to occupy it.
